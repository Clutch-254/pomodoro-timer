# 25 + 5 Clock (Pomodoro Timer)

## Overview
This application is a Pomodoro Timer, also known as a 25 + 5 Clock. It's designed to help users implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This project represents the final challenge for the Front End Development Libraries certification on freeCodeCamp.

## Features
- Customizable session and break lengths (between 1-60 minutes)
- Visual timer displaying remaining time in mm:ss format
- Start, pause, and reset functionality
- Automatic switching between session and break timers
- Audio notification when timer completes
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

## User Stories Implemented
The application fulfills all 28 user stories required by the freeCodeCamp project specifications, including:
- Adjustable session and break lengths with increment/decrement controls
- Timer functionality with proper formatting
- State management for running, paused, and reset states
- Automatic transitioning between session and break periods
- Audio alerts when timers complete
- Complete reset functionality

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Font Awesome for icons

## How to Use
1. Set your desired session and break lengths using the increment/decrement buttons
2. Click the play button to start the timer
3. Use the pause button to temporarily stop the timer if needed
4. Click the reset button to return all settings to their default values
5. When a session ends, the break timer will automatically begin and vice versa
6. An audio alert will play when each timer completes

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and open the HTML file in your web browser.
